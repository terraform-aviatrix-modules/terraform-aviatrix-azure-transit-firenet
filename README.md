account | The Azure access account on the Aviatrix controller, under which the controller will deploy this VNET
cidr | The IP CIDR wo be used to create the VNET
firewall_image | String for the firewall image to use
firewall_image_version | The firewall image version specific to the NGFW vendor image

Firewall images
```

```

Firewall image versions tested
```
Palo Alto Networks - 9.1.0
Check Point        - 8040.900294.0593
